			<p>Greetings!
So glad to be here at Learning for Life. I appreciate the hard work and dedication from the staff and
students to make LFL a great success.
I am not alone here at learning for life. As my husband reports to the Naval Post Graduate School as a
military officer, my daughter and I report to Learning for Life. I look forward to coming to my 4X2 and
helping those who want to catch up on their credits; especially, meeting with the parents on a weekly
basis, going over the assignments and sharing our lives together. One thing for sure-- dedication pays off.
It's good to be reminded weekly and to be encouraged daily.
Most of the parents and students know by now that I am very passionate about learning. I believe all that
we learn is amazing... the greatest things of the universe to the smallest wonders of a seed.
I am also known as Senora Rosa,the Spanish teacher. On Wednesdays, you will find me teaching Spanish
I where we are taken to Mexico, Spain, Argentina, and Puerto Rico to learn about the rich heritage of the
people and places that have helped shaped the world.
After five o'clock, I enjoy the long ride to San Juan Bautista where I live with my goat Margarita, dog
Sandy and my chickens. I look forward to hearing from my three sons, the oldest, Aaron, a graduate from
the Naval Academy in Annapolis and married to his beautiful wife, Lauren. My second oldest son, Micah,
is a graduate from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a successful entrepreneur in commercial
advertising and my third son, Josiah is completing his first year in Montana State University as a premed
student.
My daughter Sarah is at Montana State. Vashti, my youngest, is being prepared to go on with her career
here at Learning for Life.and will join her siblings soon at the rate she is going.
Please come by and say hello. I am happy to be part of this big, wonderful family at Learning for Life.</p>

			<p>I am the Co-founder of Learning for Life Charter School, President of the Board for Learning for Life
School, teacher and staff member.
My more than 30 years of experience in education began with teaching dance and physical education at a
high school in southern California. It has also included eight years teaching English and drama.
I then left teaching for a time and pursued an art career. What I learned there, I now share with students at
Learning for Life by teaching art classes whenever possible.
In my free time I enjoy long walks with my husband Michael and our dog Joy</p>
